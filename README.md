## Description

This is a quick and simple progressive budgeting app that I worked on for my Full Stack Web Course. The purpose of this website is to allow a user to input budget data into the website whether they're online or offline! Or for example, if a user suddenly loses internet connection their data will be stored safely offline and re-uploaded to the cloud when internet connection is restored. The website for this project is live on heroku, [click here to check it out!](https://simple-budget-tracker-site.herokuapp.com/)
